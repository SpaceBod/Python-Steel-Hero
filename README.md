The aim is to battle through endless waves as a tank, which increase in difficulty.

The enemy tanks have been programmed to follow the player and maintain a certain distance from them, and then engage in combat. If the tanks collide with obstacles, or themselves, they will navigate around the object and reach their destination.  
  
In addtion, the player can roam the map and acquire power-ups, ranging from different weapons to health restoration.  
  
A leaderboard has been set up to capture the scores of multiple players. This adds to the competitive aspect of the game.
